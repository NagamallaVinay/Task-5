# Task-5
# Decision Trees and Random Forests

Objective: Learn tree-based models for classification & regression. 
Tools:  Scikit-learn, Graphviz

Steps to be followed :
         1.Train a Decision Tree Classifier and visualize the tree.
         2.Analyze overfitting and control tree depth.
         3.Train a Random Forest and compare accuracy.
         4.Interpret feature importances.
         5.Evaluate using cross-validation


     We will Learn : Decision trees, ensemble learning, feature importance.
